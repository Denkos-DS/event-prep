# Camping and festivals

Events with no building. Camping trips, festival camps, and anything else where
the kitchen, the cold, the water, the power and the shelter all arrive in a car.

**Read this alongside `logistics.md`, not instead of it.** Multi-site, power,
batteries and solar, and cold chain are all there and all apply harder here.

## What inverts

A building supplies things silently. Remove it and each becomes a line item with
a weight, a cost and an owner.

| | Building event | No building |
|---|---|---|
| Water | free, unlimited, at a tap | ~6 L per person per day, carried |
| Cold | fridges, sized in advance | ice, consumed continuously, runs out |
| Cooking | ovens and hobs | burners and fire, ~8–10 people per burner |
| Power | wall sockets | battery and solar, output-ceiling bound |
| Waste | bins someone else empties | bags you carry out |
| Shelter | assumed | pitched, and the weather decides the day |
| Toilets | assumed | provided, dug, or rented |
| Transport | a shop nearby, second trips possible | **one trip, and that's it** |

The single biggest change is the last one. **On a chalet weekend a forgotten item
is an errand. On a festival camp it is gone for the weekend.**

## Water

**This is the line item people forget entirely, and it is the heaviest thing on
the list.**

Per person, per day:

| Use | Litres |
|---|---|
| Drinking, moderate summer | 2–3 |
| Drinking, hot weather or exertion | 4–5 |
| Cooking, coffee, rinsing | 1–2 |
| Washing up | 2–4 |
| Hands, teeth, basic hygiene | 1–2 |
| **Planning figure, summer camp** | **6** |
| Absolute floor, with a tap on site for washing | 3 |

**Ask three questions before computing anything:**

1. **Is there water on site?** A standpipe changes the number by an order of
   magnitude.
2. **Is it potable?** Non-potable still covers washing up and hands, which is
   more than half the total.
3. **How far is it, and is there a queue?** Festival standpipes at 9 AM are a
   twenty-minute round trip. That cost lands on whoever is cooking.

**Then do the weight.** 33 people × 3 days × 6 L is **594 L, which is 594 kg** —
roughly thirty 20 L jerry cans, and more than most vehicle payloads. That number
is why the water question comes before the menu, not after: if there is no water
on site, the menu has to get drier and the group has to get smaller or the trip
needs a dedicated water vehicle.

**Water is also the easiest quantity to reduce by design:**

- One-pot meals cut washing-up water more than any other choice.
- Disposable or reusable-but-wiped plates avoid a wash cycle per meal.
- A wash-up system of three basins (wash, rinse, sanitise) uses far less than
  running water and is the standard camp approach.
- Pre-prepped food chopped at home carries no rinse water into the field.

## Transport

**On a no-building event, transport is the binding constraint, and physical
footprint stops being a secondary attribute.** Read "Every quantity has a
physical footprint" in `quantities.md` first — here it is the primary filter, not
a check at the end.

Budget every line in **mass, volume and trips**, then compare against what the
vehicles actually hold with people and bedding already in them.

- **Assume one load-in.** At a festival the car goes to a field and stays there.
  Some sites allow a trolley only after a certain hour; some allow none.
- **Water and drinks are most of the weight.** 594 L of water plus 336 cans is
  well over half a tonne before food.
- **Ice is bought locally, not carried.** Find the nearest shop to the site and
  its opening hours before assuming a restock is possible.
- **Bulk before pretty.** Decant from glass and boxes at home. It halves volume
  and removes most of the waste you'd otherwise carry out.
- **A hand cart or wagon is worth more than almost any other single item** when
  the parking is not the pitch. Add it to the kit inventory.

## Cooking without an oven

**The oven's absence changes the menu, not just the method.** Anything needing
enclosed dry heat — tray bakes, roasts, anything where the point is a browned
top over a long cook — has no equivalent. Do not try to reproduce it.

What works, in rough order of how well it scales:

| Method | Scales to | Good for |
|---|---|---|
| One-pot on a burner | 10–12 per pot | stews, curries, chilli, pasta, rice dishes |
| Grill over charcoal or gas | 15–20 per grill | skewers, kofta, burgers, vegetables, flatbread |
| Foil packets in embers | unlimited, slow | potatoes, fish, vegetables |
| Cold assembly | unlimited | mezze, salads, wraps, cured meat, cheese |
| Reheat of a make-ahead | limited by pot | anything cooked at home and travelling cold |

**Burner capacity is the constraint people miss.** A two-burner propane stove
realistically feeds 8–10 people per sitting. For 33 that is three or four
stoves running at once, or a single large pot over a fire, or a menu that does
not need the whole group fed simultaneously. Count burners the way you count
ovens — see "Cooking capacity" in `logistics.md`.

**Skewers and grilled meats travel from a chalet menu to a camp menu almost
unchanged**, which is why they are the natural backbone of a camp meal plan. A
tray bake does not travel at all.

**Boiling water is a meaningful time and fuel cost at scale.** 33 coffees is
about 8 L, which is fifteen to twenty minutes on a camp burner before anyone has
eaten.

## Cold without a fridge

Ice stops being a drinks item and becomes the cold chain itself.

- **Block ice lasts two to three times longer than cubed.** Use block for keeping
  food cold and cubed only for glasses. Most people buy all cubed and lose the
  food cooler by day two.
- **Two cooler roles, never one cooler.** A food cooler that is opened four times
  a day holds days longer than a drinks cooler opened forty times. Separate them
  and say which is which on the lid.
- **Pre-chill everything at home**, including the coolers themselves. The first
  day's pull-down is the most expensive cold you will ever buy, and on mains it
  is free.
- **Frozen food is ice with calories.** Meat frozen flat in bags is the best
  cooler ice there is, and it thaws on the schedule you want it to.
- **An electric cooler is a fridge and a sustained electrical load.** Roughly
  45 W each, ~36 W average for a pair, ~864 Wh a day — see the sustained-loads
  warning in `logistics.md`. It is usually the largest single draw in a camp.

Rough planning figure for a summer camp: **1 kg of ice per person per day for
food cold, on top of whatever the drinks need.** Check the nearest shop's
distance and hours before relying on a restock.

## Food safety across days

**This is the constraint that actually shapes a multi-day camp menu**, and it
has no equivalent on a chalet weekend.

Raw meat in a cooler is fine on day one, marginal on day two and a genuine risk
on day three. So the menu arcs:

| Day | Protein |
|---|---|
| 1 | the most perishable — fresh fish, chicken, anything ground |
| 2 | whole cuts, sausages, firmer meats, or anything frozen solid on departure |
| 3+ | cured, tinned, dried, or vegetarian — halloumi, chorizo, pulses, eggs |

This arc **coincides with appetite decay** (`quantities.md`) rather than fighting
it: the day people want to eat least is the day the cooking gets simplest.

- Keep raw meat at the bottom of the cooler, sealed, never above ready-to-eat
  food.
- A cooler that has been opened all afternoon in the sun is not a fridge, whatever
  the thermometer said at breakfast.
- **Eggs do not need refrigeration** if they have not been washed and refrigerated
  before — which varies by country. In North America they do; in much of Europe
  they don't.
- Hard cheese, cured meat, most condiments, bread, and unopened UHT milk are all
  shelf-stable and should come out of the cold budget entirely.

## Fuel

Fuel is a line item, and running out mid-meal has no fallback.

| Source | Rough figure |
|---|---|
| Propane, 16 oz canister | ~2 hours of high burn on one burner |
| Propane, 20 lb tank | ~20 hours, feeds a two-burner or a grill |
| Charcoal | ~1 kg per 10 people per grilling session |
| Firewood | ~1 crate per evening for a social fire |

**Buy roughly 1.5× the computed figure.** Fuel is cheap, the failure is total,
and unused propane keeps forever. Check whether open fires and charcoal are
permitted — many sites and most festival camps ban both, and a fire ban that
arrives on the day removes the entire cooking plan.

Keep fuel at the site that consumes it, per the multi-site rule in
`logistics.md`.

## Shelter and shade

- **Shade is a food-safety item, not a comfort item.** A cooler in direct August
  sun loses its ice in a fraction of the time. Site the kitchen and the coolers in
  shade before siting anything else.
- **A canopy or gazebo over the cooking area is the highest-value single piece of
  kit** on a no-building event. It makes rain survivable and sun bearable, and it
  is where everyone ends up anyway.
- **Pitch the kitchen downwind of the tents**, and the toilets downwind of both.
- Ground matters: slope, drainage, and whether pegs will hold. Hard ground in
  August needs different pegs than soft.

## Sanitation and waste

- **Establish what the site provides before anything else** — toilets, showers,
  greywater disposal, bins. Festivals provide all of it badly; wild camping
  provides none of it.
- **Handwashing at the kitchen is non-negotiable** with a group this size. A tap
  container with a spigot, soap and a paper towel roll prevents the single most
  likely way a camp trip goes wrong.
- **Waste is carried out, so it is a volume budget.** Decanting at home is the
  cheapest way to reduce it. Bring more bags than seems sensible, plus a separate
  one for anything wet.
- **Greywater cannot go on the ground** at most sites. Ask where it goes.

## Weather

On a building event weather is a risk note. Here it is a hard dependency.

- **A wet plan and a dry plan, decided in advance.** Where do 33 people eat in
  the rain? If the answer is "the gazebo", the gazebo is mandatory kit.
- **Wind breaks burners** long before it breaks tents. A windshield around the
  cooking area is worth more than it looks.
- **Heat changes the water figure**, the ice figure and the food-safety margin at
  the same time — all three move the wrong way together.
- Check the forecast at the point where changes are still free, and name that
  moment in the schedule.

## Festival ingress rules

Festival camps add a rules layer that no other event type has, and **the rules
are enforced at a gate you cannot argue with.** Check the specific event's site,
because these vary and change year to year.

- **Glass is banned almost everywhere.** Decant spirits into plastic before you
  leave. This alone reroutes the whole drinks plan.
- **Alcohol limits per person** are common — often a fixed number of cans and a
  volume of spirits. Exceeding it means it is confiscated, not stored.
- **Cooler and container size limits**, and sometimes a ban on anything with
  wheels during certain hours.
- **Open flame and charcoal are frequently banned** in camping fields. Gas may be
  allowed with a canister size limit.
- **Re-entry rules.** If you cannot leave and return, there is no shop run and no
  ice restock — that single fact changes the entire cold plan.
- **Vehicle access ends at load-in.** Plan for one trip from car to pitch, with a
  cart, over uneven ground, possibly at night.
- **No curfew inverts the curfew cascade.** `SKILL.md` assumes music stops and
  everyone migrates home hungry. At a festival the music does not stop, people
  return at unpredictable hours across the whole night, and the food that matters
  is what someone can eat cold at 4 AM without waking anyone. Plan the late-night
  spread as the largest meal of the day, not the smallest.
- **Bring nothing you would mind losing.** Camps are not secure.

## The camp survey

Ask these before planning a menu, in place of the venue survey in
`logistics.md`. Every one of them replaces something a building would have
supplied silently.

**Water**
- Is there water on site, is it potable, how far, and is there a queue?
- If not: how much are we carrying, in what, and in whose vehicle?

**Ground and shelter**
- How far is parking from the pitch, and can a cart get there?
- Is there shade? Where will the kitchen and coolers go?
- What's the wet plan?

**Cooking**
- How many burners, and whose are they?
- Are open fires and charcoal permitted? Is there a current fire ban?
- What fuel, how much, and who is bringing it?

**Cold**
- How many coolers, what volume, and which is food and which is drinks?
- Where is the nearest ice, how far, and what are its hours?
- Can we leave and re-enter the site?

**Power**
- What batteries, panels and vehicles exist? See "Ask what's in the garage" in
  `SKILL.md` and the battery arithmetic in `logistics.md`.
- What has to run overnight? Coolers are usually the whole answer.

**Sanitation**
- Toilets, showers, greywater, bins — provided or brought?
- Where does the handwashing station go?

**Rules**, for a festival or a managed site
- Glass, alcohol limits, cooler size, open flame, wheels, re-entry, quiet hours.
- Get these from the event's own site, not from someone's memory of last year.
